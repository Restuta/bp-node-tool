# Boilerplate for Node-based console tool

## Deps

* Node 7
* Babel
* ESLint
* Nodemon
* Yarn (optional)

## Usage
- `yarn install` to install deps
- `yarn start` to run it
- `yarn run dev` to run auto-reloading nodemon server
- `yarn run eslint` to run code-analysis

## :warning: Uses `babel-register`
It's supposed to be a boilerplate for the tool and not a library. For a library you would want to compile sources with babel separately.
